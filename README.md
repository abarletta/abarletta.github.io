### <b>rndfittool</b> - _Risk-neutral Density Fitting Tool_
The _Risk-neutral Density Fitting Tool_ tool (rndfittool) allows the user to infer the risk-neutral density (RND), the risk-neutral moments and the greeks embedded in a set of observed call and put option prices. The underlying  methodology is fully non-structural, meaning that it does not rely on any parametric model, and it consists in approximating the RND through orthogonal polynomial expansions. A detailed description of this methodology is provided in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2943964">this paper</a>.

### <b>viximpv</b> - _VIX Implied Volatility Toolbox_

This toolbox computes approximate values of the Black & Scholes implied volatility of VIX options using the perturbative technique described in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2942262">this paper</a>. The modelling setup requires that the VIX index dynamics is explicitly computable as a smooth transformation of a purely diffusive, one-dimensional Markov process Y.

## About myself
My name is Andrea Barletta and I work as postdoctoral researcher in Quantitative Finance at Aarhus BSS, Denmark. 
In this page I share some MATLAB codes that I have developed for my research.

### <b>rndfittool</b> - _Risk-neutral Density Fitting Tool_
The _Risk-neutral Density Fitting Tool_ tool (rndfittool) allows the user to infer the risk-neutral density (RND), the risk-neutral moments and the greeks embedded in a set of observed call and put option prices. The underlying  methodology is fully non-structural, meaning that it does not rely on any parametric model, and it consists in approximating the RND through orthogonal polynomial expansions. A detailed description of this methodology is provided in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2943964">this paper</a>.
